# PokeScanner
A Scanning tool dedicated to helping you locate pokemon in your area. 

# Instructions
- Download the APK
- Allow installations from Unknown sources
- Install the APK
- Enter your username and password (Warning:Do not use your main account information)
- Press Scan and where ever your camera is centered is where the application will scan


# Tweaks
- Can toggle whether to show Pokemon Shuffle icons instead of the old sprites (I think they are easier to distinguish!)
- Replaced the Gym icons and Pokestop icons
- Can toggle whether to show the Pokemon icon that is currently at a Lured Pokestop instead of the Lured Pokestop icon (Filtered Pokemon will still show a Lured Pokestop icon)
- Filtered Pokemon will show up at the top of the Filtered list
- Pokestops and Gyms don't have their text above them (it was too cluttered in my opinion) (Lured Pokestops still have their timer)
- Some other minor stuff I forget

# Known issues that I don't know how to fix yet
- App crashes when switching back to it after switching to another app if it was automatically closed
- mispelled pokemon names (Geoduge and Clefary so far)
- Lured Pokestops don't disappear after expiring if "Show Only Lured" is enabled, they just turn back to blue and stay there

# PokeScanner
A Scanning tool dedicated to helping you locate pokemon in your area. Currently the tool is very limited in range I'm working on a fix to increase the range of the scanning tool.

# Instructions
- Download the APK
- Allow installations from Unknown sources
- Install the APK
- Enter your username and password (Warning:Do not use your main account information)
- Press Scan and where ever your camera is centered is where the application will scan


# Tweaks
- Changed the Pokemon icons from the really old sprites to Pokemon Shuffle icons (I think they are easier to distinguish!)
- Changed the Gym icons and Pokestop icons
- Can toggle whether to show the Pokemon icon that is currently at a Lured Pokestop instead of the Lured Pokestop icon
- Filtered Pokemon will show up at the top of the Filtered list
- Snippets (the tooptips that pop up from clicking a marker on the map) have more useful info (in my opinion)
- Pokestops and Gyms don't have their text above them (it was too cluttered in my opinion) (Lured Pokestops still have their timer)
- Some other minor stuff I forget

# To be attempted
- Notifications
- Toggleable continuous scanning


# Known issues that I don't know how to fix
- Sometimes scanning stops working until until I logoff and login again (maybe login info expires or something?)
- App crashes when switching back to it after switching to another app if it was automatically closed
